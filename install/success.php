        This doesn't mean that everything will work correctly. I have recently concluded
        that PHP is a horrible language. It can be administered by even
        more horrible people i.e (free shared hosting 'companies').  You will get the best results if you
        run your own HTTP server that doesn't have any functions disabled.

        Remember to delete the <strong>install</strong> folder for security purposes!
